## Extracting Animal Sightings from Video to Image

Hi! 

Three missing directories used to contain large files.

/lib/tf_scripts/data/

/lib/tf_scripts/pretrained_model_checkpoints/

/lib/tf_scripts/exported_models/

You can find them all here:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fi8H8ANxeh16gj2bINv3eHoCeQ7hT-vp

Put them in the correct place after cloning the directory.
