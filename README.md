## Original Model
Link to the original model [code](https://github.com/vpabba03/Grouper_Moon_Detection/tree/main/original_model)
- Trained using Tensorflow V1, so weights cannot be updated currently due to being in a frozen weights set.

## WildMe Model
Link to the WildMe model [testing](https://github.com/vpabba03/Grouper_Moon_Detection/tree/main/wildme_model)
- Already training for object detection, need to test on still frames.

## Fishial.AI Model
Website [https://www.fishial.ai/](https://www.fishial.ai/)
- Model works decently well, but works only on segmented input data.
- Can possibly retrain if dataset is present.
